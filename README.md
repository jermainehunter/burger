# burger app

This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize, and follows the MVC design pattern.

Devour a Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move below in the devoured section

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

As an added bonus, I created a delete button to delete burgers that have been devoured and even those that have yet to be devoured.

Enjoy!
